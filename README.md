## Growth Mindset Explanation

Growth mindset is the mindframe of having natural talent but also incorporating the effort into succeeding in something.

### Three reminders to stay in a growth mindset

1. Always remember you can get smarter
2. Everyone above you was once at the point you are
3. You just need to remember you havent learned or made it **YET**
