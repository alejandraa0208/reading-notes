# Class 02 Notes

## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

- Middleware is like an assistant for web applications. Think of the web application as a party and middleware are the hosts at the door that check invitation, serve drinks and ensure that everyone has a good time.

Express the most popular middleware.

Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

- It means that it doesn't force developers to follow a specific set of rules or a particular way of doing things.

What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

- A module is a small contained package of code. It can be used to break down a large program into smaller managable modules. Useful for reusability, maintainability and collaboration.

## What is NPM?

What version of npm are you running on your machine?

- Version 9.8.0

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

- npm install jshint

## What is TDD?

Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

- Imagine building a bridge and before anyone drives on it the engineers need to conduct multiple tests to make sure its safw and sturdy. So software development need to make sure the quality of their work is correct and reliable.

What are three expected benefits of testing?

- Three benefits are reliablility, maintenance and documentation.

Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

- 2 individal pitfalls are overconfidence and skippping edge cases.

2 team pitfalls are lack of comomunication and test maintenance.

## CI/CD

What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

- 3 benefits of continuous integration are early bug detection, consistent code quality and faster development.

What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

- The difference between conintuous delivery and continuous deployment is that delivery is code changes are automatically built, tested and prepared for release to production and deployment is when code pass all tests and checks then deployed to the production environment without manual intervention.

Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background?

- Github can be looked at as a digital collaboration platform for building and managing projects. It includes storing and organizing work, version control, collaboration, and integration with CI/CD.
