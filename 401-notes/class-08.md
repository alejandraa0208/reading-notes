### 5 steps to RBAC

What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?

- It is a method of managing access to computer systems or network resources based on roles and permissions. We care due to access control, security, and simplicity and scalability.

Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.

- A role we would implement is admin which has full control over the system. Permission would be to write which allows to create or modify data.

What approach might you take to implement RBAC?

- I would identify roles, assign permissions, assign users to roles, access control lists or policies, logging and monitoring and education and training.

### wiki - RBAC

If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?

- It is the process of determining what actions or operations a user is allowed.

Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.

- Role assignment, role permissions and role authorization.

Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.

- RBAC is like giving people roles in a company. A manager has certain responsibilities, an employee has others, and an intern has their own. Each role comes with a set of things they can and cannot do. RBAC helps ensure that everyone in the company can access the right tools and information they need to do their job, but nothing more. It's like playing a well-organized game where everyone knows their role and the rules they need to follow.
