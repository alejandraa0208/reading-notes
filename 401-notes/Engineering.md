# Discussion Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- I have developed several types of skills sets through my career paths. Skills from the military, private investigating and financial fraud. I've dealt with different scenarios of careers to fit and adapt to give employers what they want.

2.What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- I'll start taking a break to recharge my brain so it doesn't fry, try to look at the problem piece by piece so I don't overlook anything and then ask for help more often.
