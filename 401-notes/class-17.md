### AWS Lambda Basics

What is AWS Lambda?

- A serverless compute service provided byw AWS

Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.

- Used for event-driven computing, automation of tsks, data processing, real-time file processing, and building serverless applications

Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.

- magine you want to bake a cake, but you don't have to worry about buying ingredients, preheating the oven, or setting a timer. Instead, you just tell a magical baker what kind of cake you want, and they make it for you. They handle everything behind the scenes, and you only pay for the cake once it's ready.

In the world of computers, "serverless" is a bit like that magical baker. It's a way to build and run applications without having to manage servers or worry about all the technical details. You just write your code, and a serverless platform takes care of running it when needed. You don't need to think about servers, hardware, or infrastructure. It's like having your own team of invisible helpers doing all the work in the background, and you only pay for the computing power you actually use. It's simple, cost-effective, and lets you focus on your application instead of server management.

### CDN

What is a CDN?

- A network of distributed servers that work together to deliver web content efficiently

How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

- When a website visitor requests content (e.g., images, videos), the CDN routes the request to the nearest server (edge server) instead of the website's origin server. This reduces latency and speeds up content delivery.

What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

- CDNs improve website performance, reduce server load, provide better security, and enhance scalability. They ensure faster loading times for users globally.
