## NOSQL vs SQL

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	

- Structured Query Language

- Relational databases

- Fixed schema

- ACID transactions

- Suitable for structured data

NoSQL

- Not Only SQL

- Non-relational databases

- Dynamic or flexible schema

- Eventual consistency

- Suitable for semi-structured and unstructured data

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Give a real world example.

- Structured data with well-defined relationships such as data that can be organized into tables with rows and columns.

Example: An example could be the database for an online store. It has tables for customers, orders, products and payments.

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Give a real world example.

- Semi-structured or unstructured data where relationships between data points are not clearly defined such as social media posts or activity logs.

Example: Social media platform that stores content like posts, comments and likes.

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

- NoSQL is better suited due to their flexible schema.

Which type of database is best for scalability?

- NoSQL databases are better suited due to dealing with massive amounts of data and it can be horizontally scaled across multiple servers and nodes.
