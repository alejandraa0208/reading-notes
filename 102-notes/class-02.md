# Choosing A Text Editor Notes 

A text editor is software that you install in your computer or use online that 
allows you write and manage text. It is one of the most important tools you'll use
as an web developer. 

1. What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
- The four features are code completion, syntax highlighting, a nice variety of themes
  and the ability to choose from healthy selection of extensions.

2. What do the following commands do?
   
       1. pwd = full path to working directory
       2. ls = short listing
       3. cd = home directory
       4. mkdir = create new directory
       5. touch = create a new file

4. Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario?
   
      1. cd projects
      2. mkdire new-project
      3. touch new-project/newfile.md
      4. cd ..
      5. ls projects/new-project
  
- Basically, going into the projects directory, creating a new directory called
  \"new project", then creating a new file in the new project directory called
  \"new file.md and then going back to the previous directory and seeing all components
  from the new project directory.
