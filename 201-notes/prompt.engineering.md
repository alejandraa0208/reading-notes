Changing a tire on a 2016 Chevy Cruze involves several steps. Here's a general guide on how to do it:

1. Find a safe location: If possible, park your Chevy Cruze on a flat, stable surface away from traffic. Engage the parking brake and turn on the hazard lights.

2. Prepare the tools: Locate the spare tire, jack, lug wrench, and the wheel lock key (if applicable). These tools are typically found in the trunk of the vehicle.

3. Loosen the lug nuts: Use the lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts on the flat tire. Turn them counterclockwise, but don't remove them just yet.

4. Position the jack: Locate the proper jack points under your Chevy Cruze. Refer to the vehicle's owner's manual for specific instructions. Place the jack securely under the designated point.

5. Lift the vehicle: Use the jack handle or a wrench to pump the jack, raising the car until the flat tire is off the ground. Ensure the vehicle is stable and the jack is supporting it securely.

6. Remove the lug nuts and the flat tire: Completely remove the lug nuts and set them aside. Carefully take off the flat tire and set it aside as well.

7. Install the spare tire: Lift the spare tire onto the wheel hub and align the holes with the lug bolts. Push the spare tire onto the hub until it's fully seated.

8. Tighten the lug nuts: Begin tightening the lug nuts by hand until they're snug. Then, use the lug wrench to further tighten them in a star or crisscross pattern. This helps ensure even tightening. Avoid over-tightening.

9. Lower the vehicle: Slowly lower the vehicle using the jack. Once the spare tire touches the ground, remove the jack and place it aside.

10. Tighten the lug nuts again: With the vehicle on the ground, use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts one final time in a star or crisscross pattern.

11. Stow the flat tire and tools: Place the flat tire, jack, lug wrench, and any other tools back into the trunk of your Chevy Cruze.

12. Check the spare tire pressure: Confirm that the spare tire is properly inflated. If needed, adjust the tire pressure to the recommended level.

Remember to have the damaged tire repaired or replaced as soon as possible, as spare tires are typically intended for temporary use only.

It's essential to consult your vehicle's owner's manual for specific instructions and safety precautions that may be unique to your Chevy Cruze model.
