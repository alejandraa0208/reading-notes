# Class 04 Notes

This page is to get more into CSS layouts and reusable coding.

## Creating Hyperlinks

1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

- You wrap it in the \<a> tag.

2.The href attribute contains what information?

- This contains the web address.

3.What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

- Incorporating descriptive link text, no repeating URLs, and keep it as short as possible

## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

1. What is meant by “normal flow”?

- The way the webpage elements lay themselves out if you havent made any changes.

2.What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

3.Static positioning is the default for every html element.
4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

- Precise control, layering and overlapping, independence from surrounding elements, responsive design and animation and transitions

5.What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

## Functions - Reusable Blocks of Code

1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

- A function declaration is a statement that defines a new function in JS. A function invocation executes a function in JS.

2.What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

- A parameter is a variable declared and acts as a placeholder for a value the function expects to receive. An argument is a value or expression that is passed to a function when invoked. 

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

- Two benefits are increased collaboration and learning and improved code quality. These benefit my coding journey because it actively helps improve my technique by opening up my perspectives and giving me more knowledge.

## Things I want to know more about

I would love to get into pair programming because bettering my coding technique is all I thrive for.
