# Class 07 Notes

## Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

- Its a better software design, makes it easy to communicate ideas and system layouts, and makes it easy to maintain the software that is developed.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

- Using tables can cause semantic misuse, accessibility issues and slower page loading.

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table>.

- \<thead> is used in the header section and is used to group header rows.

- \<tbody> is used in the body section and used to group main content or rows of data. 

- <tfoot> is used in the footer to group and maintain summary infromation.

## Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

- A constructor is a special method and automatically called when an object of a class is created. Some advantages are that it will ensure an object is initialized properly and when objects are created it makes it easier to understand.

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

- In object literal, 'this' is refers to the object itself.

- In constructor function, 'this' is used to set properties on the newly created object.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

Based off my experience working as a Fraud Operations specialist at Wellsfargo. Prototypes can be represented by senior fraud specialists like myself that has a well-defined knowledge and the procedures of our department. Inheritance can be represented by any new hires that need to be trained by the senior specialist to learn the knowledge and procedures being able to handle the inquires just like the senior specialist would be able to. 
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question.
