# Class 02 Notes 

This relates to understanding the fundamentals of coding.

## Intro to HTML questions

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

- Semantic elements give meaning, content and appearance to our code.

2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

- There are 6 levels.

3. What are some uses for the \<sup> and \<sub> elements?

- The \<sup> tag defines superscripted text and \<sub> tag defines subscript text.

4. When using the \<abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

- The title attribute must be added.

## CSS Questions

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

- You can apply CSS by external stylesheet, internal stylesheet and inline styles. (sourced from 'How CSS Is Structured')

2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?

- It is the least efficient implementation for maintenance. It mixes presentational code with HTML and content causing everything to be difficult to read. (sourced from 'How CSS Is Structured')

3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

- What is representing the selector?
h2 is representing the selector
- Which components are the CSS declarations?
color: black and padding: 5px are declarations
- Which components are considered properties?
color and padding are properties

## JS Questions

1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

- It represents a string data type

2. List 4 types of Javascript operators.

- Assignment operators, equality operators, relational operators and arithmetic operators.

3. Describe a real world problem you could solve with a function.

- A function that can calculate the total cost of your shopping cart. Each item placed in the cart are inputs and calculate the cost of summing the prices of all the items.Handling different pricing, discounts and tax. 

## Making decisions in your code questions

1. An if statemtent checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.
2. What is the use of an 'else if'? 

- It is used to add additional conditions to an if statement. Allowing multiple conditions to be evaluated. 

3. List 3 different types of comparison operators.

- Equal to (==), not equal to (!=) and great that (>) and less than (<). 

4. What is the difference between the logical operator && and \|| ?

- For the &&: it returns true if both operands are true and multiple conditions can be executed. If any are false, it returns false. 
- For \||: it returns true if either operand is true and if both are false then it returns false.

## Things I want to know more about

I need to practice more with operators to be able to get the feel of when to use them in my code.
