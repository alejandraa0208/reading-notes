# Class 10 Notes

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- Syntax Errors happen when there are missing semicolons, parentheses or curly braces. This prevents the code from being executed at all.

- Logic error is caused by incorrect login or mistakes in the code during the runtime of code execution.

2.List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- In past labs I kept running into the issue of my app not running correctly and not being able to figure out the issue and it being as simple as a missing parenthesis or angle bracket. You really need to go through your code for any little thing.

3.How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

- This will make me get in the habit of making sure each syntax is correct and reducing the chances for bugs so I can create the app more efficient.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1.How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

- The debugger is great for checkpoint throughout your code to make sure its runing properly. It inspects each element and does a step by step execution and if there are any bugs it can narrow down where your bug is for you to fix it.

2.Define what a breakpoint is.

- Its like a checkpoint where the code stopes to be examined and debugger does its job.

3.What is the call stack?

- It keeps track of the active function calls while the program is being executed.
